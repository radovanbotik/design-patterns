                    Controlled Modal

1.We create a modal component that accepts 3 parameters
    1.state
    2.function that mutates the state
    3.children

2.modal component is conditionaly rendered upon state value
    {state && modal}
3.modalbackground has an onclick event that fires 
  function that changes state to false so we close the modal
4.modalbody has onclick event that stops propagation of click
  from background
5.inside modalbody we have a button that has onclick event that
  fires a function that changes the value of state to false

6.we set up the state inside the app/ parent component
  we pass state of the modal to the modal component
  we also pass a setter function that will change state to false


const [modalState,setModalState] = useState(false)

const app = () =>{
    return(
        <modal
            state={modalState}
            function={()=>setModalState(false)}
        >
          <h3>this is children</h3>
        </modal>



    )
