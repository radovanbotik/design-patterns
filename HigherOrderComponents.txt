                                Higher Order Components

1.  Higher order components are components that rather than JSX
    return another component.

    HOC ---> SomeComponent ---> JSX <h1>hi this is title</h1>

    Basicly they are just functions that return components.

2.  Use:
    #Sharing complex behavior between multiple components
    (Similiar to container components)
    #Adding extra functionality to existing components
