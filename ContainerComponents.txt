					Container Components

1.Components that take care of loading and managing data for their child components.
2.Components shouldnt know where their data is coming from.
<container>
	<child1/>
	<child2/>
	<child3/>
<container/>

normally  
each child fetches data and then renders them
const Child1 = () => {
//load data...
return(
//display data
)
}

instead 
data is fetched once in container and then redisributed to children
const Container = () => {
//load data...
return (
//pass data to children
)
}

const Child1 = ({children}) => {
return(
//display data
)
}
