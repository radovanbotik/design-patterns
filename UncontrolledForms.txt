                         Uncontrolled Form

1. We create ref with React.createRef() store it into variable and then 
   use this variable to reference it in the element
   const nameInput = React.createRef();
   <input type='text' name='name' ref={nameInput}/>
2. So we have to create ref for each individual input
3. On submit we then gather the data from the refs:

    using input.current.value

const handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log(
        firstNameInput.current.value,
        lastNameInput.current.value
        ...
    )
}

In the end nothing is happening until submit event is fired.
Only then we receive info from the inputs.
